#DESCERPTION:-
During my internship at Codtect IT Solutions, I successfully completed the assigned tasks by actively applying the guidance provided by mentors and utilizing available online resources. The experience helped me enhance both my technical and problem-solving skills.

To complete the tasks, I referred to the solutions and instructions shared by the company, which gave me a strong foundational understanding of the project requirements. Whenever I encountered challenges or needed additional clarity, I independently explored solutions using Google and trusted online forums like Stack Overflow and official documentation. This approach allowed me to learn how to troubleshoot issues, find alternative solutions, and understand best practices in real-world development.

Through this process, I gained hands-on experience and confidence in working on live projects. I also improved my ability to research efficiently and apply solutions effectively. This internship not only strengthened my technical knowledge but also taught me the importance of self-learning, responsibility, and time management.

Overall, completing the tasks with the help of provided solutions and external learning tools was a valuable and rewarding experience in my journey toward becoming a better developer.
